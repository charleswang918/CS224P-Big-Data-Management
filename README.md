## Project descrption can be found in [ZotMusic Vision.pdf](ZotMusic%20Vision.pdf).

## [HW1 Details.pdf](HW1/HW1%20Details.pdf): ER Relational DBMS (PostgreSQL)
This homework focuses on refreshing SQL skills by designing and implementing a relational database for the ZotMusic platform, an AI-generated music service. Tasks include creating tables from an E-R model, loading data into PostgreSQL, and exploring the data with SQL queries to analyze users, records, and ratings.
## [HW2 Details.pdf](HW1/HW2%20Details.pdf): Cassandra
This homework involves exploring Apache Cassandra as a scalable database solution for the ZotMusic platform. It includes tasks such as converting PostgreSQL schemas into Cassandra data models, exporting and importing data, optimizing table designs for query-specific requirements, and implementing a Python script to interact with Cassandra. The assignment emphasizes practical database migration and application development.
## [HW3 Details.pdf](HW3/HW3%20Details.pdf): MongoDB
This homework focuses on using MongoDB for data management and analysis in the ZotMusic platform. Tasks include setting up a cloud-based MongoDB cluster, loading JSON-based ZotMusic data, and performing schema analysis and queries using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL). The assignment emphasizes the use of aggregation pipelines, advanced queries, and Python integration via PyMongo to analyze user behavior, records, and reviews.
## [HW4 Details.pdf](HW4/HW4%20Details.pdf): Neo4J
This homework introduces graph database concepts using Neo4j to analyze ZotMusic data. Tasks include loading CSV datasets as nodes and relationships, designing multi-labeled graph structures, and writing Cypher queries to explore connectivity insights. The assignment emphasizes understanding graph relationships, running advanced queries, and leveraging Neo4j’s visualization and shortest path features for practical data exploration.
## [HW5 Details.pdf](HW5/HW5%20Details.pdf): Spark
This homework focuses on leveraging Apache Spark for big data analytics with the ZotMusic platform. Tasks include exploring the Spark framework using Databricks, analyzing data with Spark DataFrames and SQL, performing complex aggregations, and experimenting with large datasets on both single-node and multi-node environments. The assignment emphasizes scalable data processing and comparative performance evaluation across different computing setups.
## [HW6 Details.pdf](HW6/HW1%20Details.pdf): Flink
This homework introduces real-time stream processing using Apache Flink to analyze ZotMusic data. Tasks include filtering and aggregating JSON-based data streams, calculating user engagement metrics, tracking trending records, and identifying high-activity dates using Flink’s DataStream and Table APIs. The assignment emphasizes understanding Flink’s real-time processing capabilities, including windowing and event-time handling, to derive actionable insights.
